# 👨🏼‍💻 I Learn Javascript : Price Calculation<br/>
## My First Js Application<br/>
This application is used to calculate the total price when adding or removing extra products on ecommerce sites such as Themeforest. <br/>
I may have made some absurd mistakes as I am just trying to learn javascript. Maybe you can help me improve myself on this subject.🌟 <br/><br/>

I made "**Custom Selectbox** and **Custom Checkbox**"
